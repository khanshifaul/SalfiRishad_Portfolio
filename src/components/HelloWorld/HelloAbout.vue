                            I’m Salfi Bari Khan, a passionate traveler, photographer, and an aspiring tourism
                            professional
                            from Bangladesh. With a Diploma in Computer Technology, I have a strong foundation in
                            problem-solving and technical skills. But my heart has always been drawn to the world beyond
                            the
                            screen—toward the landscapes, cultures, and stories of the places I visit. I have always
                            believed that travel is a transformative experience, and through my lens as a photographer,
                            I
                            seek to capture the beauty and richness of the world.</div>

                        <div>
                            My passion for photography and travel led me to explore tourism as a career. During my
                            travels, I’ve had the privilege to experience different cultures, connect with people, and
                            learn about the history that shapes places and their identities. I realized that tourism is
                            not just about sightseeing—it's about creating meaningful experiences, bridging cultures,
                            and promoting understanding. With my technical background, I want to bring innovation to the
                            tourism industry by leveraging technology to improve how we experience and connect with
                            different parts of the world.</div>

                    <div>
                        I am driven by a desire to explore and understand the world. Photography has taught me to see
                        the world differently—to find beauty in everyday moments and capture it in a way that tells a
                        story. My curiosity and love for history push me to dig deeper into the places I visit, to learn
                        about their past, and understand how that history shapes their present. My goal is to use
                        tourism as a way to connect people from different cultures, fostering understanding and
                        appreciation for the diversity that makes our world so incredible. I also want to contribute to
                        sustainable tourism practices that respect local communities and preserve cultural and natural
                        heritage for future generations.</div>

                    <div>
                        Russia is a country of immense cultural heritage and diversity, with a history that spans
                        centuries. Studying tourism in Russia will allow me to explore its rich history, grand
                        architecture, and natural wonders firsthand. From Moscow's vibrant cityscape to the serene
                        beauty of Lake Baikal, Russia offers an incredible range of experiences that I believe are
                        essential for developing a global perspective on tourism. The opportunity to study here under
                        the Russian government scholarship will help me build the skills and knowledge needed to work in
                        the international tourism industry and share Russia’s beauty with the world.</div>

                    <div>
                        Tourism has the power to unite people across borders and cultures, and I see it as a platform
                        for positive change. I plan to combine my technical background with my love for travel and
                        creativity to bring innovative approaches to tourism. Whether it's through designing better user
                        experiences for travelers, creating digital content that showcases hidden gems, or developing
                        sustainable travel practices, I aim to contribute to an industry that enriches both travelers
                        and the communities they visit.</div>

                    <div>
                        After completing my bachelor’s degree in tourism from Russia, I plan to return to Bangladesh
                        with the skills, knowledge, and global insights I’ve gained. Bangladesh is a country rich in
                        natural beauty and cultural heritage, but its tourism potential remains largely untapped. From
                        the pristine beaches of Cox’s Bazar to the historical landmarks in Dhaka and the serene
                        Sundarbans mangrove forests, there is so much that can be showcased to the world.

                        I aim to contribute to the development of sustainable and responsible tourism in my country.
                        With a solid understanding of global tourism trends, combined with innovative strategies that I
                        will learn in Russia, I plan to help position Bangladesh as an attractive destination for both
                        international and domestic travelers. I want to work with local tourism boards, private
                        enterprises, and communities to create tourism models that benefit both the economy and the
                        environment. My technical background will also allow me to integrate modern digital tools, such
                        as interactive platforms and virtual experiences, to make Bangladesh’s tourism more accessible
                        to a global audience.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="text-xl lg:text-2xl lg:leading-normal">
                    <div class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 pb-8">How My Studies Can Help My Country</div>
                    <div>
                        By studying tourism in Russia, I will gain exposure to one of the world’s most historically rich
                        and culturally diverse regions, learning best practices in tourism management, sustainability,
                        and cultural promotion. These lessons can be applied to Bangladesh, where the tourism industry
                        is still developing. My education will allow me to introduce advanced tourism strategies that
                        focus on promoting Bangladesh's cultural heritage, natural beauty, and adventure tourism, while
                        ensuring sustainable practices are followed to protect the environment and local communities.

                        Moreover, my experience in Russia will provide me with a deeper understanding of international
                        tourism markets, which can help attract tourists to Bangladesh. I plan to foster collaborations
                        between Russian and Bangladeshi tourism organizations, encouraging exchange programs and
                        partnerships that can promote mutual tourism growth. Ultimately, my goal is to create a tourism
                        model in Bangladesh that benefits local communities by creating jobs, preserving our heritage,
                        and promoting cultural exchange, all while attracting a new wave of tourists who can experience
                        the unique beauty of my homeland.</div>
